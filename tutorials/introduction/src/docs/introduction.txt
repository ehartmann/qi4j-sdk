== Overview ==

TIP: Theses tutorials are based on actual code found in the `tutorials/` directory of the Qi4j SDK sources. You should
start your favorite editor and find the code related to this tutorial, run it and play with it.

In this section you will find a comprehensive set of tutorials about Composite
Oriented Programming using Qi4j.

[[tutorials-intro,Introduction to Qi4j]]
=== Introduction to Qi4j ===

This quite long introduction to Qi4j will start by brushing up an overview of the problems Qi4j solve, teach you what
Composite Oriented Programming is and guide you through the process of writing a complete Application around an adapted
Hello World example.

=== Transient Composites Tutorial ===

Throughout this set of tutorials it will be shown how to create and work with Transient Composites, which is the basic
element in Qi4j. We will refactor one HelloWorld class to take advantage of the various features in Qi4j. These
refactorings will make it easier to reuse parts of the class, and introduce new features without having to change
existing code. We will also look at some of the existing classes, or Fragments, available in Qi4j that you can reuse
so that you don't have to write everything yourself.

Each tutorial step in this series starts with the result from the previous tutorial, so you can
always look at the next tutorial step for guidance on what to do.

At the bottom of each tutorial step, the is Solutions section, which list the files you should have come to if you
have followed the instructions.

=== Services Composites Tutorial ===

CAUTION: This tutorial is still work-in-progress!

In this other set of tutorials it will be shown how to create and work with Service Composites, which are composites
that extends from the ServiceComposite class. We will refactor one a very simple Library where you can borrow and
return books to take advantage of the various features in Qi4j. These refactorings will benefit from automatic Service
activation and Configuration Entities management.
